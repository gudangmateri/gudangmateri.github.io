<p>We dont experience many deaths in One Piece but when we do they are made to count. The car accident Nick saw didnt happen until the end and were left with the possibility that one of our own is dead. Ace refused due to his disdain for the system and although Draw shared his feelings the Vice Admiral took the opportunity to kill him. As everyone else stares in shock at Aces wounds they deduce that his organs were burned beyond help and tell Luffy that Ace will not make it. But who Portgas D Ace really was. With Aces Vivre Card burning up Luffy looks on in horror.</p>

The incident with Ace demonstrated to Waller that Batmans greatest attributes were his compassion and his iron refusal to never take a life. Nick immediately noticed Aces arm hanging out where one of the firefighters was checking on him. Carrier outside of a flashback.</p>
